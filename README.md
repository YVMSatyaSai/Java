For loop:-
If you know how many iterations you want to go for loop
(intiliazing vaue, condition, increment or decrement)

While loop:-
When you need to read the file go for while loop, if the number of iterations is not known.

- For loop can also be used as a while.
 
Do While Loop:-
If you condition get false but you want to exceute the code at least once.

Need of **Array**:-
int i=5;
int j=6;
int k=7;
int num[]= {5,6,7};
int num[]=new int[4];

**Drawbacks of Array**:-
- The memory allocation is contiguous.
- The size of an array is fixed. Array size cannot be expand.
- Searching takes time.
- Array can store values of only same type. It can store homogeneous type value only.
